Project: Responsive Web Page Implementation
Overview
This project is a from-scratch implementation of a responsive web page using pure HTML and CSS, adhering to accessibility best practices and responsive design principles. The goal was to create a fully functional web page that matches the provided Figma design, ensuring pixel-perfect accuracy, cross-device compatibility, and an optimal user experience.
Features

Responsive Design: The web page seamlessly adapts to different screen sizes, with a dedicated mobile layout triggered at a maximum screen width of 480px.
Accessibility: Semantic HTML elements, ARIA attributes, and keyboard navigation support ensure the page is accessible to all users, including those using assistive technologies.
Interactive Elements:
Links feature a hover and active state with a color change to #FF6565.
Buttons have a hover and active state with an opacity reduction to 0.9.


Centered Content: The main content is constrained to a maximum width of 1000px and centered on the page for optimal readability.
Custom Fonts: The design incorporates Source Sans Pro and Spin Cycle OT fonts, ensuring visual consistency with the Figma mockup.
No External Libraries: The implementation relies entirely on vanilla HTML and CSS, showcasing core web development skills.

Design Specifications

Fonts: 
Source Sans Pro: Used for body text and headings.
Spin Cycle OT: Used for specific decorative or stylized text elements as per the Figma design.
Fallback fonts are provided in the CSS to ensure graceful degradation if custom fonts are unavailable.


Colors:
Links (hover/active): #FF6565
Button (hover/active): Opacity set to 0.9


Layout:
Maximum content width: 1000px, centered horizontally.
Mobile breakpoint: 480px or less, triggering a mobile-optimized layout.


Rounding: Floating-point values from the Figma design have been rounded to the nearest whole pixel for simplicity and consistency.

Installation and Setup

Clone the Repository:git clone <repository-url>


Navigate to the Project Directory:cd <project-directory>


Open the Web Page:
Open index.html in a web browser to view the page.
No additional dependencies or build steps are required, as the project uses only vanilla HTML and CSS.

Usage

Desktop View: The page displays with a maximum content width of 1000px, centered on the screen.
Mobile View: When the screen width is 480px or less, the layout switches to a mobile-friendly design, with adjusted font sizes, spacing, and element arrangements.
Interactions:
Hover over links to see the #FF6565 color transition.
Click or hover on buttons to observe the opacity change to 0.9.


Accessibility:
Navigate the page using a keyboard to ensure all interactive elements are focusable.
Screen readers will interpret semantic HTML and ARIA attributes for a consistent experience.



Development Notes

Fonts: Ensure Source Sans Pro and Spin Cycle OT are available on your system or included in the assets/ folder. The CSS includes fallback fonts (sans-serif) for robustness.
Responsive Breakpoints: Media queries are used to handle the mobile layout at max-width: 480px. Additional breakpoints may be implemented for intermediate screen sizes if specified in the Figma design.
Accessibility Considerations:
Semantic HTML elements (header, nav, main, footer, etc.) are used to improve structure.
ARIA roles and attributes enhance screen reader compatibility.
High-contrast colors and focus states ensure usability for visually impaired users.


Rounding: Floating-point values from the Figma design were rounded to whole pixels to maintain consistency across browsers.

Testing

Browsers Tested: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge (latest versions as of June 2025).
Devices Tested: Desktop (1920x1080, 1440x900), Tablet (768x1024), Mobile (360x640, 480x800).
Accessibility Testing:
Tested with screen readers (NVDA, VoiceOver).
Keyboard navigation verified for all interactive elements.


Tools: Browser DevTools, Lighthouse (for performance and accessibility audits).

Future Improvements

Add support for additional breakpoints to enhance responsiveness on intermediate screen sizes.
Optimize font loading with font-display: swap to improve perceived performance.
Incorporate automated accessibility testing (e.g., axe-core) in a CI pipeline.
Explore CSS Grid or Flexbox enhancements for more complex layouts if required by future iterations.
